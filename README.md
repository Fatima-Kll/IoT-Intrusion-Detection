# IoT Intrusion Detection Project

## 📌 Project Overview 

This project focuses on detecting malicious activities in Internet of Things (IoT) environments using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques.

The work is based on generating **normal and attack traffic** in an IoT environment using MQTT and CoAP protocols.  
Traffic generation was performed using the **IoT-Flock framework**, which was configured and executed locally to simulate realistic IoT environments.

The generated traffic was captured, processed into a dataset, and used to train Machine Learning and Deep Learning models for intrusion detection.

This project was developed as a **final academic project**.


## Key Contributions
- Local generation of labeled IoT attack traffic (MQTT & CoAP)
- Creation of a reproducible intrusion detection dataset
- Comparative evaluation of ML, anomaly detection, and Deep Learning models
- Analysis of protocol-specific attack detection challenges

## 🔧 Traffic Generation with IoT-Flock

IoT-Flock was used as a traffic generation framework to simulate realistic IoT environments and produce both normal and malicious network traffic.

The framework was configured and executed locally to:
- Generate MQTT and CoAP traffic
- Simulate different attack scenarios
- Produce PCAP files for dataset creation

Only the generated traffic and datasets were used in this project.  
The IoT-Flock source code is **not included** in this repository.
